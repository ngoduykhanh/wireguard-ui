# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, I greatly value feedback and contributions from my community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure I have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

I welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of my code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
