# wireguard-ui

A web user interface to manage your WireGuard setup.

## Features
- Friendly UI
- Authentication
- Manage extra client's information (name, email, etc)
- Retrieve configs using QR code / file

## Run WireGuard-UI

Default username and password are `admin`.

### Using docker compose

You can take a look at this example of [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/wireguard-ui/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml). Please adjust volume mount points to work with your setup. Then run it like below:

```
docker-compose up
```

Note:

There is a Status option that needs docker to be able to access the network of the host in order to read the 
wireguard interface stats. See the `cap_add` and `network_mode` options on the docker-compose.yaml


### Environment Variables


Set the `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable to a random value.

In order to send the wireguard configuration to clients via email, set the following environment variables:

- using SendGrid API

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY: Your sendgrid api key
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: the email address you registered on sendgrid
EMAIL_FROM_NAME: the sender's email address
```

- using SMTP

```
SMTP_HOSTNAME
SMTP_PORT
SMTP_USERNAME
SMTP_PASSWORD
SMTP_AUTH_TYPE
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: the sender's email address
EMAIL_FROM_NAME: the sender's name
```

In order to connect to a database, set the following environment
variables:

```
DB_TYPE
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_DATABASE
DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD
DB_TLS: the TLS option
```

For details on the values that these variables should be set to, see the
section for your desired database.

### Using binary file

Download the binary file from the release and run it with command:

```
./wireguard-ui
```

## Databases

By default, all the data for the application is stored in JSON files in
the `./db` directory. By using the `--db-type` command line option or by
setting the `DB_TYPE` environment variable, you can choose to use a
different backend. Note: for some backends, other options may need to be
set.

Backend options:

| Value | Database | Other options |
| ----- | -------- | ------------- |
| jsondb | JSON files in `./db` | None |
| mysql | MySQL or MariaDB server | `DB_HOST` `DB_PORT` `DB_DATABASE` `DB_USERNAME` `DB_PASSWORD` `DB_TLS` |

### JSONDB

When using the JSONDB database, all of the data is stored in separate
JSON files in the `./db` directory. This is the default database and no
special configuration is required. 

### MySQL

In order to use a MySQL or MariaDB server, you will first have to set
the `DB_TYPE` environment variable to `mysql`. You should then specify
the hostname or IP address of the database server using `DB_HOST` as
well as the port on which the database server is listening, if it is
different from the default of `3306`. `DB_DATABASE` is the name of the
database that WireGuard-UI is to use. Please ensure that the database is
empty before you start WireGuard-UI for the first time otherwise the
tables will not be initialized properly. `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`
should contain the login details for a user with the following
permissions for the database:

* SELECT
* INSERT
* UPDATE
* DELETE
* CREATE
* ALTER

`DB_TLS` sets the TLS configuration for the database connection. It
defaults to `false` and can be one of the following values:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| false | Never use TLS (default) |
| true | Enable TLS / SSL encrypted connection to the server |
| prefered | Use TLS when advertised by the server |
| skip-verify | Use TLS, but don't check against a CA |

After you have set these options, you should be able to start the
WireGuard-UI server. The server will then initialize the database and
insert the default configuration. If this process is interrupted, you
will have to empty the database and restart the initialization.
## Auto restart WireGuard daemon
WireGuard-UI only takes care of configuration generation. You can use systemd to watch for the changes and restart the service. Following is an example:

### systemd

Create /etc/systemd/system/wgui.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Restart WireGuard
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0.service

[Install]
RequiredBy=wgui.path
```

Create /etc/systemd/system/wgui.path

```
[Unit]
Description=Watch /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf for changes

[Path]
PathModified=/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Apply it

```
systemctl enable wgui.{path,service}
systemctl start wgui.{path,service}
```

### openrc

Create and `chmod +x` /usr/local/bin/wgui
```
#!/bin/sh
wg-quick down wg0
wg-quick up wg0
```

Create and `chmod +x` /etc/init.d/wgui
```
#!/sbin/openrc-run

command=/sbin/inotifyd
command_args="/usr/local/bin/wgui /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf:w"
pidfile=/run/${RC_SVCNAME}.pid
command_background=yes
```

Apply it

```
rc-service wgui start
rc-update add wgui default
```

## Build

### Build docker image

Go to the project root directory and run the following command:

```
docker build -t wireguard-ui .
```

### Build binary file

Prepare the assets directory

```
./prepare_assets.sh
```

Then you can embed resources by generating Go source code

```
rice embed-go
go build -o wireguard-ui
```

Or, append resources to executable as zip file

```
go build -o wireguard-ui
rice append --exec wireguard-ui
```
